# Course Materials

This directory contains markdown materials provided by the tutor, specifically formatted for AI assistants. These materials provide important context and instructions for each task.

## Structure

Materials should be organized by task number, matching the structure in the `solutions` directory. For example:

```
materials/
├── task1/
│   └── instructions.md
├── task2/
│   ├── context.md
│   └── requirements.md
└── ...
```

## Usage

When working with an AI assistant:
1. Reference these materials in your conversation
2. The assistant can read and understand the context from these files
3. This helps ensure solutions align with the tutor's requirements

## Adding New Materials

When you receive new materials from the tutor:
1. Create a new directory for the task if it doesn't exist
2. Save the markdown files with descriptive names
3. Update this README if the structure changes significantly
